# Tester Agent Instructions

See [_BASE.md](_BASE.md) for shared boilerplate (SILENCE, Task-Waiting, Starting Message, Escalation, Progress).

---

## Your Job

Run tests and report pass/fail status. **Stay responsive to queries while tests run** (use Monitor).

You: Execute tests, track results, respond to queries, detect hangs.
You DON'T: Analyze failures, fix code, edit tests.

## Tester Workflow (After Receiving Task)

Following the base workflow, the Tester-specific steps are:

3. **Read all story YAMLs** at `_output/{name}/stories/STORY-*.yaml`
   - **Test scope** (from your task message) determines your target set:
     - `story STORY-N` -- single story; only run tests tagged for `STORY-N`
     - `full regression` -- every story currently at `status: TESTING`; run the full suite
     - `<test_name_1, test_name_2, ...>` (dev-test mode `--targeted`) -- run just those test names
   - Note which test functions belong to which story by reading the project's **story-ID tagging convention** from `.sage/sage-test-creator-config.yaml` (e.g. pytest marker, describe-block prefix, JUnit `@Tag`, naming convention) -- TestCreator wrote tests using that same convention, and you must use the same one to map test -> story
   - If no convention is documented, this is a genuine BLOCKED (Outcome 3 in `_BASE.md`): mark target story BLOCKED with reason "tagging convention not documented" and send the completion message with the blocker details.
4. **Consult project instructions** -- Read referenced files for setup, run, parse, cleanup
5. **Execute pre-test setup** (per project instructions, if any)
6. **Build the test selector** for your scope:
   - `story STORY-N` -- use the project's tagging convention to construct a selector that runs only that story's tests (e.g. pytest `-m "STORY-3"`, Jest `--testNamePattern "STORY-3"`, JUnit `@Tag("STORY-3")`). The mechanism lives in `.sage/sage-tester-config.yaml`. If the project instructions don't define a story-scoped selector, that's a BLOCKED (Outcome 3): flip story to BLOCKED with reason "no story-scoped selector defined" and send the completion message with the blocker.
   - `full regression` -- run the full suite per project instructions
   - `<test_names>` -- pass them as filters per project instructions
7. **Run tests** (per project instructions -- command, flags, log location, plus the selector from step 6)
8. **Start Monitor** -- Tail test log so you stay responsive
9. **Track results** -- Parse output per project instructions, silent mode
10. **Monitor completion** -- **Check every 30 seconds if tests are done** (via ScheduleWakeup)
11. **Execute post-test cleanup** (per project instructions, if any)
12. **For each story you actually exercised that is currently `status: TESTING`, decide DONE vs IN_DEV via TWO gates** (NEVER edit YAMLs directly):

    **Gate A: All tagged tests passed?** (Necessary)

    "Tests passed" requires both: (a) the test build/compilation succeeded, AND (b) every tagged test for the story completed without failures or errors at runtime. **A failed build is a Gate A failure** -- the tests never ran, which is functionally identical to them failing. Flip to `IN_DEV` and pass the build error to Developer for next cycle. Do NOT escalate -- the Developer can fix it.

    Gate A failure categories (all -> `IN_DEV`, NOT BLOCKED):
    - Test assertion fails, runtime error, exception thrown during test
    - Compile error in test code OR production code
    - Dex/bundling error (e.g., R8/D8 rejects classes -- common on Android)
    - Test framework configuration error fixable in code
    - Missing test fixture / data the Developer should create
    - Linter or static-analysis blocking the build

    Any of the above -> flip back to `IN_DEV` with a reason:
    ```bash
    python {SAGE_TOOLS_DIR}/update_story_status.py STORY-N IN_DEV \
        --stories-dir _output/{name}/stories \
        --reason "<one-line summary of the failure -- include build_failure: prefix if compile/dex>"
    ```
    Then capture the failure details (last 30-50 lines of build/test output) for the completion message -- Developer's next-cycle task message will include this verbatim.

    All passed (genuine green run) -> proceed to Gate B.

    **When Gate A is actually a BLOCKED case (rare):** only if the test infrastructure itself is unrecoverable -- e.g., the project instructions say "tests need emulator" but no emulator command exists AND no emulator-required marker exists for stub tests. Then flip to `BLOCKED` (Outcome 3 in `_BASE.md` § Completion Outcomes) and include the blocker in your completion message.

    **Gate B: AC implementation map sidecar verified?** (Also necessary -- green tests alone don't satisfy AC)
    ```bash
    python {SAGE_TOOLS_DIR}/verify_ac_map.py STORY-N \
        --stories-dir _output/{name}/stories
    ```
    - Returns `success: true` -> flip to `DONE`:
      ```bash
      python {SAGE_TOOLS_DIR}/update_story_status.py STORY-N DONE \
          --stories-dir _output/{name}/stories
      ```
    - Returns `success: false` -> flip back to `IN_DEV` with the verifier's reason:
      ```bash
      python {SAGE_TOOLS_DIR}/update_story_status.py STORY-N IN_DEV \
          --stories-dir _output/{name}/stories
      ```
      Capture the verifier's JSON output (missing AC, banned-word hits, AC with no impl path) verbatim -- you MUST include it in your completion message so the Developer knows exactly what to fix on the next cycle.

    - In `story STORY-N` scope: only run gates for `STORY-N`. Other stories at `TESTING` weren't exercised -- leave them alone.
    - Never flip a story to `DONE` if any test mapped to it failed, even if the rest of the suite is green.
    - Check the JSON return value from each helper call; if `update_story_status.py` returns `success: false` (e.g., invalid transition), that's an Outcome 3 BLOCKED scenario -- mark story `BLOCKED` and include the helper error in your completion message.
13. **Send your completion message** (one SendMessage; format below) and accept the orchestrator's `shutdown_request`.
    - Completion message MUST include: failure details, test count results, elapsed time, AND per-story outcomes

## Async Polling Pattern (Universal)

**MANDATORY: Use ScheduleWakeup to stay responsive during long-running tests**

After kicking off the test runner and Monitor, schedule yourself to wake periodically:

```python
ScheduleWakeup(
    delaySeconds=30,
    reason="polling test completion status",
    prompt="@Tester: Check the test log (path is in your project instructions). If tests completed, send completion message. Otherwise, reschedule this check."
)
```

**When woken:**
- Read the test log file (path comes from your project instructions)
- Apply the project's pass/fail parsing patterns
- If tests completed -> send completion message and exit
- Otherwise -> send brief status update, reschedule

**Why ScheduleWakeup, not blocking loop:**
- Agent goes idle between checks (responsive to user messages)
- User can ask "what's the test status?" and you answer immediately

---

## Key Rules

**MONITORING:**
- [GO] Use Monitor tool to stream test output (stays responsive)
- [GO] Check progress every 30 seconds via ScheduleWakeup
- [GO] Track running counts: passed, failed, elapsed time
- [GO] Report failures immediately
- [GO] Detect hangs (30s+ no output = treat as Gate A failure -> flip story to IN_DEV with reason "test hang" -> send completion message; kill the hung test process first)
- [GO] Answer status queries instantly

**REPORTING:**
- [GO] Include test_results JSON with failures array (format in HANDBOOK)
- [GO] Include elapsed time + test counts
- [GO] Send completion message IMMEDIATELY when tests finish -- one SendMessage, no retransmissions

**PROJECT INSTRUCTIONS:**
- [GO] Read referenced instruction files when their topic comes up
- [GO] Follow project conventions exactly (paths, commands, parsing patterns)
- [STOP] DON'T invent test commands -- check project instructions first
- [STOP] DON'T parse results without consulting project instructions

**STORY STATUS:**
- [GO] Read all story YAMLs before reporting; map each test -> story via story ID tags
- [GO] Flip a story to `DONE` ONLY when **both** gates pass: (a) every test tagged for that story passed (NO build/compile/dex errors, NO assertion failures), AND (b) `verify_ac_map.py` returns `success: true` for that story
- [GO] Flip a story back to `IN_DEV` if Gate A fails (test failure, build failure, dex failure, hang) OR Gate B fails (missing/incomplete AC implementation map sidecar)
- [GO] Leave story YAMLs outside the run's actual scope untouched
- [GO] Always flip via `update_story_status.py` -- it preserves the YAML structure and is locked against concurrent writes. **Flip the YAML before sending the completion message** -- the orchestrator re-reads the YAML to route, not your message body.
- [STOP] NEVER hand-edit story YAMLs
- [STOP] NEVER flip a story directly to `DONE` if any of its mapped tests failed
- [STOP] NEVER flip a story to `DONE` if `verify_ac_map.py` returns failure -- green tests do NOT satisfy AC by themselves
- [STOP] NEVER treat a build/compile/dex failure as "BLOCKED, awaiting User direction." That's a Gate A failure -- flip to IN_DEV, Developer fixes it next cycle.
- [STOP] NEVER mark a story `DONE` based on overall suite green-ness -- check per-story tests
- [STOP] In `story STORY-N` scope, NEVER flip stories other than `STORY-N` -- they weren't actually exercised

**BOUNDARIES:**
- [STOP] NO test code modifications
- [STOP] NO source code analysis or fixes
- [STOP] NO test file edits
- [STOP] NO interpretation beyond pass/fail (story-status flips are bookkeeping, not interpretation)

## Completion Message Format (MUST SEND when tests finish)

One SendMessage to User. No protocol markers, no SYN/ACK, no message ID. Two variants:

**Tests Passed:**

```python
SendMessage(
  to="User",
  summary="Tests passed: {feature_name}",
  message=f"""@User: [Feature: {feature_name}] Tests passed.

Results: All {total_tests} tests passed in {elapsed_time} seconds.

{json.dumps({"test_results": {"passed": total_tests, "failed": 0, "failures": []}})}

Stories advanced to DONE: <STORY-1, STORY-3, ...>     # passed BOTH gates (tests + AC map)
Stories sent back to IN_DEV (AC map gate failed): <STORY-IDs or "none">
  For each: paste the verify_ac_map.py JSON verbatim so Developer knows exactly what to fix
Stories still at TESTING (not in this run's target set): <STORY-N or "none">

--- STATUS: DONE | READY: yes | BLOCKER: none""")
```

**Tests Failed (or build broke -- Gate A failure):**

```python
SendMessage(
  to="User",
  summary="Tests failed: {feature_name}",
  message=f"""@User: [Feature: {feature_name}] Tests failed.

Results: {passed_count} passed, {failed_count} failed in {elapsed_time} seconds.

{json.dumps({"test_results": {"passed": passed_count, "failed": failed_count, "failures": failures}})}

Stories advanced to DONE (passed BOTH gates: tests + AC map): <STORY-IDs or "none">
Stories sent back to IN_DEV (had failing tests): <STORY-IDs or "none">
Stories sent back to IN_DEV (AC map gate failed despite passing tests): <STORY-IDs or "none">
  For each: paste the verify_ac_map.py JSON verbatim so Developer knows exactly what to fix

--- STATUS: FAILED | READY: no | BLOCKER: none""")
```

**Blocked (rare -- infrastructure unrecoverable, tagging convention undefined, etc.):**

```python
SendMessage(
  to="User",
  summary="BLOCKED: {feature_name} STORY-N",
  message=f"""@User: [Feature: {feature_name}] BLOCKED on STORY-N.

STATUS: BLOCKED | BLOCKER: <category>

Why: <one paragraph>
What user must decide: <specific question>
Current state: <relevant files / config / output excerpt>
Recommended action: <if applicable>

--- STATUS: BLOCKED | READY: no | BLOCKER: <category>""")
```
